Summary
-------
Use git-ftp.sh to only deploy files to a FTP server, which were modified since
the last deployment. This saves time and bandwith.

About
-----
I use git-ftp.sh for my script based projects, mostly PHP. Most of the low-cost
web hoster does not provide SSH nor git support, only FTP. 

That is why I needed a easy way to deploy my git tracked projects. Instead to transfer
the whole project, I thought, why not only transfer the files which changed since 
the last time, git can tell me those files. 

And git-ftp.sh was born.


Installing
----------
Make sure git and curl is installed.
    # aptitude install git-core curl

The easiest way is to use git for installing:
   
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/git-ftp.sh.git
    $ cd ~/dev/git-ftp.sh.git
    $ git clone http://github.com/resmo/git-ftp.sh.git .    
    $ cd ~/bin/   
    $ ln -s ~/dev/git-ftp.sh.git git-ftp
    
After this you can use 'git ftp' or 'git-ftp'


Usage
-----
The first time, git-ftp.sh will upload all files and remembers the sha1.

    $ cd my_git_tracked_project
    $ git ftp -H <ftp.example.com> -u <user> -p <password>
    
Later only the changed files will be uploaded
    $ git ftp -H <ftp.example.com> -u <user> -p <password>
    
You can also use the -i option for prompting the password

    $ git ftp -H <ftp.example.com> -u <user> -i
