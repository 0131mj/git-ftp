Description: Uploads the git tracked files to a FTP server
 git-ftp is a shell script for uploading git tracked files to a FTP server. 
 By default, it uploads only those files which have changed since the last 
 upload. 
 This saves time and bandwith. You can even play with different branches. See 
 manpage for more options.
